# Adafruit_IO_Python_CLI
CLI wrapper around the adafruit IO API and client library

This is a basic CLI written in Python (with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/))
to provide easy feed reading access to the command line.  This only provides read  access
and does not provide full functionality of the API.
